# Password Generator 3

## Description
    In this project, I created a randomized password generator based on minimal provided starter code. I created variables to store all of the different character types that the user could input, including: lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. I then created an empty array to store all of the user's choices to apply to the later provided password. A function containing all the prompts to gain user input was created. This function contain conditions anticpating a user inputting a number out of the parameters for the length of the password or answering no to all character types. If both of these conditions are true, then the loop will bring you back to the beginning of the prompt. The end of this function will call a second function that will generate the randomized portion of the password. A for loop will create each randomized character in the password and stop at the desired password length. The given query selector will add the generated password into the HTML and it will then appear into the box on the screen. 

    Here is a link to the deployed site: 

## Installation
    N/A

## Usage 
    The purpose of this project is to create a randomized password based on the password criteria provided via prompts. To use this site, there will be a red button named "Generate Password." When clicked, the site will launch a series of prompts and confirm pop-ups. Once the user answers the prompts, if the parameters provided fall into the required criteria, a password will appear in the box.
